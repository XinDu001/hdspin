# üöÄ Features

‚ö° Fast spin-flips using [decimal representation and bit-flip operations](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/hdspin/blob/master/inc/spin.h), driven by the [Arbitrary Precision](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5319814/Arbitrary-Precision-Easy-to-use-Cplusplus-Library) (AP) library, no need to store an expensive `std::vector<int>` for every system anymore.

‚ö° System energies are stored using a [least recently used cache](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/lru-cache-implementation/), leading to orders of magnitude more memory saving and together wth the AP library, arbitrarily large systems.

‚ö° [MPI load-balancer](https://github.com/matthewcarbone/hdspin/blob/master/src/main_utils.cpp), allowing for massively parallel simulations on high-performance computing systems. The rare time-consuming job no longer holds up other simulations.

# üôè Software acknowledgement

Much of this work would have been significantly harder if not for some incredible products of the open source community! 

The hdspin software hosts codes locally as per the permissive terms of the associated licenses (check out this explicitly clear [blog post](https://levelofindirection.com/blog/unit-testing-in-cpp-and-objective-c-just-got-ridiculously-easier-still.html) regarding the Catch library for more details, if you're interested). These excellent packages are:

- Niels Lohmann's [Json](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) header, for handling config serialization to disk
- Alexander Ponomarev's [LRU cache](https://github.com/lamerman/cpp-lru-cache) header, for handling the... LRU cache
- [Catch2](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2) (the header-only version), for unit testing
- [CLI11](https://github.com/CLIUtils/CLI11) for all command line argument needs
- The [Arbitrary Precision](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5319814/Arbitrary-Precision-Easy-to-use-Cplusplus-Library) library, for all arbitrary precision integer uses
